## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

i learnt a lot about flexbox during this project especially the align-self property.

### Continued development

This project has made me realize how much i didn't know about flexbox and css grid and i'm looking forward to learning more about them.
